NLP - Document classification

**Thought process**

1. Find a dataset any platform for text/document classification that is
  - Considerably small - less than few hundred mb
  - Not trivial datasets(likes of Spam vs Ham)
  - Not well documented
  - Interesting to work on

2. Do the work ;)

I've chosen [BBC Full Text Document Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamkushwaha/bbc-full-text-document-classification)
1. Since it is exactly what recruit is looking for - *Document Classification*
1. Not binary classification (5 categories)
1. Usability(5) is not too low nor too high
1. Less size
1. Has very less number of existing kernels/notebooks


Below datasets are considered in no particular order. This took me around 60 mins to search, read, decide and finalize on the dataset
